# Life OS Security Audit Report

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented and vulnerabilities addressed in the Life OS application.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Server Security
- ✅ Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- ✅ Implemented CORS with origin restrictions
- ✅ Added rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes, 10 OpenAI requests per minute)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints
- ✅ Request size limits (10MB max)

### 2. Authentication Security
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- ✅ Email normalization (trim and lowercase)
- ✅ User ID validation in database queries

### 3. Payment Security (Razorpay)
- ✅ Input validation for plan IDs and billing cycles
- ✅ Amount range validation (max ₹100,000)
- ✅ Signature verification for payment confirmations
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling

### 4. Database Security
- ✅ User ID validation in all database queries
- ✅ Input sanitization for Supabase operations
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled via Supabase
- ✅ Parameterized queries (no SQL injection risk)

### 5. Code Quality
- ✅ Removed sensitive console.log statements
- ✅ Added ESLint configuration with security rules
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore to prevent sensitive file commits
- ✅ Input validation throughout the application

### 6. Environment Security
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code
- ✅ Secure API key handling

## Known Vulnerabilities

### npm Audit Issues
The following vulnerabilities are present in dependencies but are not critical for this application:

1. **nth-check <2.0.1** (High) - Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
   - Impact: Low - Only affects SVG processing in development
   - Mitigation: Will be resolved when react-scripts is updated

2. **postcss <8.4.31** (Moderate) - PostCSS line return parsing error
   - Impact: Low - Development dependency only
   - Mitigation: Will be resolved with react-scripts update

3. **webpack-dev-server <=5.2.0** (Moderate) - Source code exposure
   - Impact: Low - Development server only
   - Mitigation: Not applicable in production

## Security Best Practices Followed

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Email format validation using regex
- Password strength requirements
- Request size limits

### Authentication
- Secure password handling
- Email normalization
- User session management via Supabase

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization
- Error handling without information disclosure
- CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- User data isolation via user_id filtering
- Secure database queries
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Update Dependencies**: When possible, update react-scripts to resolve npm audit issues
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
3. **Monitoring**: Implement application monitoring and logging
4. **Backup**: Regular database backups
5. **Updates**: Regular security updates for all dependencies
